## Reporting a Vulnerability
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

If you discover a security vulnerability in our MVVM toolkit library, we encourage you to report it privately to avoid potential abuse.

Please email all security concerns to: ankitmaurya295@gmail.com

You can expect an acknowledgment within 48â€“72 hours, and we aim to provide a resolution or mitigation within 7 working days depending on the severity and complexity.

If the vulnerability is valid and fixed, we will credit the reporter in the release notes (if desired).
Please do not disclose any vulnerabilities publicly before we have addressed them.

Thank you for helping us keep the library secure for the community!
